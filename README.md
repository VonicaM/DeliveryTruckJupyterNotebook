# DeliveryTruckJupyterNotebook
This is the exact same program as in the DeliveryTruck repository, simply in the form of a Jupyter Notebook page. It comes with some extra visuals.

To run this program, you must first have python installed, which can be gotten from Python.org. You will also need a few more extensions. These can be installed by going into the command line in Windows, and using the commands “pip install notebook”, “pip install pandas”, and “pip install matplotlib”.

With all of that, you can then use the Windows command line to navigate to the directory containing the Main_Page.ipynb file. There, you can use the command “python -m notebook” to open the project. A web page will be opened up, where the code can be executed, and the attached visuals seen.
